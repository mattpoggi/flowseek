## :clapper: Introduction
We present FlowSeek, a novel framework for optical flow requiring minimal hardware resources for training. FlowSeek marries the latest advances on the design space of optical flow networks with cutting-edge single-image depth foundation models and classical low-dimensional motion parametrization, implementing a compact, yet accurate architecture. FlowSeek is trained on a single consumer-grade GPU, a hardware budget about 8× lower compared to most recent methods, and still achieves superior cross-dataset generalization on Sintel Final and KITTI, with a relative improvement of 10 and 15% over the previous state-of-the-art SEA-RAFT, as well as on Spring and LayeredFlow datasets.

**Contributions:** 

* We introduce **FlowSeek**, the first optical flow model that integrates a pre-trained **depth foundation model**. 

* We explore **different design strategies** to best exploit the prior knowledge of the foundation model for the optical flow estimation task.

* We develop **several variants** of FlowSeek, implementing different trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, yet maintaining the **single-GPU requirement at training time**.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Getting Started

This code has been tested with nVIDIA Drivers version 550.54.14 and CUDA Libraries version 12.1.

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure that you have installed all the necessary dependencies. The list of dependencies can be found in the ```requirements.txt``` file.

2. **Download required datasets**: 
To evaluate/train FlowSeek, you will need to download the required datasets: [FlyingChairs](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/FlyingChairs.en.html#flyingchairs), [FlyingThings3D](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/SceneFlowDatasets.en.html), [Sintel](http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/), [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=flow), [HD1K](http://hci-benchmark.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/), [TartanAir](https://theairlab.org/tartanair-dataset/), and [Spring](https://spring-benchmark.org/).
By default `datasets.py` will search for the datasets in the locations pointed by the config file ```configs/datapaths.py```. You can edit the file with the proper paths in your file system

4. **Download pre-trained models**:
You can download Depth Anything v2 pre-trained weights (and ours) by running

```
bash scripts/get_weights.sh
```

## :gear: Training

You can train FlowSeek by setting the variable ```SIZE``` either to T or M inside ```scripts/train.sh```, and then run

```shell
bash scripts/train.sh
```

## :rocket: Testing

You can evaluate our pre-trained models by simply running

```shell
bash scripts/eval.sh
```

or you can evaluate your own checkpoint ``$checkpoint`` by running

```
python evaluate.py --cfg config/eval/flowseek-[T,S,M,L].json --model $checkpoint --dataset [sintel, kitti, spring, layeredflow]
```

## :art: Qualitative Results

You can reproduce the qualitative results from either the main paper or the supplementary material by running

```
bash scripts/qualitatives.sh
```
